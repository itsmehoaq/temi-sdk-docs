**Step 1**: Make sure you are connected to the same WiFi network as your robot.

**Step 2**: On temi - go to Settings -> temi Developer Tools -> tap on ADB Port Opening.

**Step 3**: On computer - Using the IP address on the top right of temiâ€™s screen you can connect to the robot and test your code. In order to establish a connection with the robot, type following command in Terminal on Mac or Command Prompt on Windows.

``` shell
adb connect <IP_ADDRESS>:5555
