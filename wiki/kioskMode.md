# Kiosk Mode

Kiosk mode is a configuration of your temi skill that allows it to take over the home screen application and instead of the default temi home screen.

In the temi Settings -> Home Screen -> Application, you can set any app as home screen application.
But only the app who declares to be kiosk app in the manifest and actually selected as home screen app can be granted with special permissions, including overriding voice flow, restart the system, etc.

## Integration

To configure the skill as a kiosk skill you must take the following steps:

1. Open the `AndroidManifest.xml` .

2. In the **application** tag paste the following piece of code:

    ``` xml
    <!-- Ignore this if it has been added -->
    <meta-data
        android:name="com.robotemi.sdk.metadata.SKILL"
        android:value="@string/app_name" />

    <meta-data
        android:name="com.robotemi.sdk.metadata.KIOSK"
        android:value="TRUE" />
    ```

3. Compile and run the skill.

4. Even though the skill is visible now it is still not set as your temi's kiosk skill, to do so navigate to the settings menu. Now that you have a kiosk skill running you should see a new option in the settings called _Kiosk Mode_. Until the skill is set by launcher to be the default skill its' status will be _OFF_.

5. Click on the kiosk mode option and open the Kiosk Mode page. Turn on the kiosk mode from the top right corner.

6. Select your skill from the list of skills available for kiosk mode configuration. In the case where there is only one of those, it will automatically be selected for you when the mode is turned on.
